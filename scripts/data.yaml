    stars: 4.5
    downloads: 22799378
    description: >-
      Integrates ESLint into VS Code. If you are new to ESLint check the
      documentation.

      The extension uses the ESLint library installed in the opened workspace folder. If the folder doesn't provide one the extension looks for a global install version. If you haven't installed ESLint either locally or globally do so by running npm install eslint in the workspace folder for a local install or npm install -g eslint for a global install.

      On new folders you might also need to create a .eslintrc configuration file. You can do this by either using the VS Code command Create ESLint configuration or by running the eslint command in a terminal. If you have installed ESLint globally (see above) then run eslint --init in a terminal. If you have installed ESLint locally then run .

      ode_modules.bineslint --init under Windows and ./node_modules/.bin/eslint --init under Linux and Mac.

    description:
      Every time you press the Enter key in a Python context, this extension will parse your Python file up to the location of your cursor, and determine exactly how much the next line (or two in the case of hanging indents) should be indented and how much nearby lines should be un-indented.

      There are three main cases when determining the correct indentation, described below.

      This extension quickly searches (using ripgrep) your workspace for comment tags like TODO and FIXME, and displays them in a tree view in the activity bar. The view can be dragged out of the activity bar into the explorer pane (or anywhere else you would prefer it to be).

      Clicking a TODO within the tree will open the file and put the cursor on the line containing the TODO.

      Found TODOs can also be highlighted in open files.
